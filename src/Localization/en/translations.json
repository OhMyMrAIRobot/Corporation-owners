        "timelineText": "On March 5, 1975, the first meeting of a group of enthusiasts called the \"Homemade Computer Club\" was held. All of them were also engineers and \"fans\" of computer technology, united by their desire to change the popular perception of computers as very expensive and bulky devices that require special skills to use. The introduction of new technologies into the lives of ordinary people was supposed to be through the promotion of independent design and handicraft manufacture of computers. Steve Wozniak attended the meeting. Already after the first meeting, he was eager to design the machine that later became known as Apple I. By the end of June, he had already obtained the first result unique for the time: the display of characters typed on a keyboard. Woz immediately demonstrated his invention to Steve Jobs, who was impressed by it. After that, Jobs also began to visit the \"Homemade Computer Club\", in any case, in 1975 he was at several meetings: Woz demonstrated his computer to other members of the club at the end of meetings, and Jobs helped him to drag a TV set, which served as a display, as well as with the setup. Jobs soon enough struck up a conversation about the commercial potential of Wozniak's invention. First of all, he convinced Woz to stop giving away computer blueprints to anyone who wanted them, even though this did not meet the principles of the \"Home Computer Club\", created for the free exchange of ideas and selfless mutual assistance. Steve offered Voz to sell in the club ready-made circuit boards, that is, to take the most difficult part of the work on himself, and the buyer would have to solder chips to the board on the ready-made drawings. According to Jobs' calculations, the production of one board would cost 20 dollars, and he was going to sell them twice as expensive. Wozniak was initially skeptical of the idea: the business required at least $1,000 in start-up investment, which could pay off after the sale of 50 units of goods. Although the club already had about 500 members, many of them were proponents of fancy off-the-shelf solutions like the Altair 8800, and Woz didn't see enough customers. But Jobs knew his friend too well. He didn't try to convince Wozniak that the company was bound to be profitable, but painted their venture as an exciting adventure. And it worked."

          "timelineText": "To raise the necessary sum, Jobs had to sell his hippie Volkswagen T1 van and switch to a bicycle, while Wozniak sold one of his main treasures - a programmable calculator HP-65. From the proceeds, Jobs paid a familiar Atari employee to create a circuit board schematic that could then be put into mass production. In January 1976, the first batch of boards arrived at the companions' disposal. Jobs needed a third voice in case of disagreement with Wozniak, and Steve took in a share of another engineer from Atari, his friend Ron Wayne, who had a bad experience of running his own business producing slot machines for casinos, and therefore well versed in the law and drafting documents. Jobs also hoped with Wayne's help to convince Wozniak to quit designing calculators for Hewlett-Packard and fully concentrate on their business. It remained to register the company and could start selling the product. But first it was necessary to decide on the name of the future company. Jobs had just returned from Oregon, from Friedland's One Farm. This farm was a real hippie commune - Steve pruned apple trees there and even went on an apple diet, becoming a fruitarian and deciding that now he was clean and it was enough for him to wash not more than once a week. He returned to Los Altos absolutely happy. Woz met him at the airport and took him by car into town. On the way they chose a name for the future company, because the next morning they had to file the documents for its registration. Jobs suggested \"Apple Computer\": it sounded fun, energetic and not scary. The word \"apple\" softened the serious \"computer\". Plus, in the phone book, we'd end up with Atari's Steve Jobs. Jobs stated that if nothing better was proposed by morning, the Apple name would remain. And so it did. Therefore, the computer designed by Wozniak was named Apple I.The company was incorporated on April 1, 1976. The three-party partnership agreement was drafted by Wayne, he also wrote the first manual for Apple I and created the first Apple logo."

          "timelineText": "Jobs took the very dubious step of ordering unsold Lisa \"line\" computers to have Macintosh emulation installed and marketed under the Macintosh XL brand. Sales tripled, but it was essentially a deception that many of Apple's top technicians revolted against. Jobs' second failure was the launch of an advertising campaign for the Macintosh Office suite. The bundle was supposed to consist of a file server, networking equipment for Macintosh terminals on AppleTalk protocols, and a LaserWriter laser printer. Jobs tried to take the same assertive and aggressive tone that had brought success the year before, but he \"overreached\". The slump in sales and questionable management actions caused the departure of a number of leading specialists, whom Jobs parted with too easily and self-confidently. The crisis also caused Jobs and Sculley's working relationship to deteriorate, leading to a power struggle between them. Jobs by this time had already considered Sculley an unsuitable person to lead the company and generally \"bad for Apple\". However, the management did not support him, and it was decided to gradually remove Jobs from the management of the company, especially since he had the idea of creating a research center AppleLabs, where he could become an effective manager. He asked several times for a postponement, but in the end he couldn't resist - he planned to organize a coup in Sculley's absence on the board of directors and seize power. Even Jobs' staunchest supporters thought the plan was crazy and tried to talk him out of it. Scully found out about it, canceled the trip, and on May 24, 1985, at a board meeting, exposed Jobs' plans. The board sided with Scully and fired Jobs as head of the Macintosh division. Steve felt betrayed and abandoned by everyone. He was assigned a small house, away from the main Apple buildings, Jobs called it \"Siberia\". After a while, he simply stopped going to work and made sure no one noticed his absence. So Jobs held the formal position of chairman of the board of directors for five months, with no real authority, before leaving Apple and founding NeXT Inc. the same year."

          "timelineText": "In 1985, Jobs met Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Paul Berg. Berg shared his ideas about a computer for scientific research: it should be personal, powerful, and inexpensive. Jobs launched the Big Mac project to create such a computer. However, after Jobs left Apple in the fall of 1985, his successor Jean-Louis Gasset closed the project. Now Jobs had a chance to realize his vision in his own company. The company logo was designed by the famous designer Paul Rand for 100 thousand dollars. Jobs poached some like-minded Macintosh team members - lead programmer Bud Tribble, lead engineers George Crowe and Rich Page, chief accountant Susan Barnes, artist-designer Susan Kare, marketer Daniel Levin - and with $7 million dollars incorporated NeXT Inc. Jobs saw his new challenge as creating a computer for the needs of science and education. The problem was that Apple had a strong position in that market alone. A year later, there was almost nothing left of the 7 million, and the asset of the new company was only a logo and fancy offices. Businessman and philanthropist Ross Perot saved the situation, in 1987 he bought 16% of the company for 20 million dollars, which was the first major investment in NeXT. Steve ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection. Together with Esslinger, they designed the NeXT computer, an idea Jobs had. NeXT computers did not go on sale until mid-1989 at a price of $6,500 and were initially sold in limited quantities to universities with a pre-installed beta version of the NeXTSTEP operating system. Jobs advertised the NeXTcube as the first \"interpersonal\" computer to replace the personal computer. With its innovative multimedia e-mail system, NeXTMail, the NeXTcube allowed voice, images, graphics and video to be shared via e-mail. \"Interpersonal computers are revolutionizing human communications and group work,\" Jobs told reporters. Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT station was technologically advanced, but was generally rejected by the industry as too expensive. Among those who could afford it, however, NeXT gained a following because of its technical advantages, chief among them an object-oriented software development system. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and wrote the world's first hypertext web browser at CERN using a NeXT computer, and John Carmack wrote the games Wolfenstein 3D and Doom on it."

          "timelineText": "NeXT, which had shrunk to NeXT Software Inc. to 240 employees, supplying advanced software to such major customers as Dell, The Walt Disney Company, WorldCom, and the BBC, was at a dead end. Jobs realized that he could not get out on his own, and again began to look towards Apple, which was also not doing brilliantly. After Jobs' departure, Apple held on to old ideas and developments for a few years, and then its market share fell from 16% to 4%. The first conversation between Steve Jobs and Apple director Gil Amelio about a possible merger or takeover of NeXT took place in 1994: NeXT had the NeXTSTEP multitasking object-oriented operating system and its OpenStep application programming interface, while Apple had the hardware and manufacturing facilities. Two years later, Amelio realized the depth of Apple's crisis and returned to Jobs' proposal. Competing with NeXT for the right to merge with Apple was Be Inc., founded in 1990 by Jean-Louis Gasset, who had once succeeded Jobs as head of the Macintosh division and closed his Big Mac project. After buying NeXT, much of the company's technology found its way into Apple products - most notably NeXTSTEP, which became the basis for Mac OS X. On December 20, Jobs returned to the company he had founded and was introduced to the Apple team as \"advisor to the chairman\". The company immediately began to feel the movement: production was reduced, and a series of personnel changes and reshuffles followed. It became clear that Jobs would try to reclaim Apple for himself, although he called himself only a \"consultant\" and denied any claims to power, citing his busyness at Pixar and the need to devote more time to his family. At the same time, Jobs quickly managed to lead people loyal to him to key positions in the company and gained a fairly unambiguous reputation. In September, Jobs was officially named interim CEO and became the de facto head of Apple. In March 1998, Jobs went to drastic measures to revitalize the company. He shut down a number of projects such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc."

At the age of 13, he enrolled at Lakeside Private Preparatory School, where he wrote his first program. At 17, Gates formed a business with Allen called Traf-O-Data to produce traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. In 1972, he served in the House of Representatives of Congress. He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside High School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on scholastic tests and entered Harvard College in the fall of 1973.He chose to major in law, but took courses in mathematics (including Math 55) and computer science. While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years, while Ballmer stayed and graduated with honors. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft and held the position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014. Gates developed the pancake sorting algorithm as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by Professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and his successor is only 2% faster. His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou. Gates continued to communicate with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell in the summer of 1974. In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800, based on the Intel 8080 processor, was released, and Gates and Allen saw an opportunity to start their own computer software company. Gates left his studies at Harvard that same year. His parents supported him, seeing how much he wanted to start his own company. He explained his decision to leave Harvard this way, \"If things didn't work out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on sabbatical\""

          "timelineText": "Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine, in which the Altair 8800 was demonstrated, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to say that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for that platform. Gates and Allen didn't actually have an Altair and weren't writing code for it; they just wanted to gauge MITS' interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet with them for a demonstration, and within a few weeks they had developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then a BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at the MITS office in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and led to a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen called their partnership \"Micro-Soft,\" a combination of the words \"microcomputer\" and \"software,\" and their first office was in Al Bookerka. Gates and Allen's first employee was their high school chum Rick Weiland. A year later, they dropped the hyphen and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the New Mexico Secretary of State on November 26, 1976. Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. The Altair BASIC language developed by Microsoft was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-production copy had leaked into the marketplace and was widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates published an open letter to hobbyists in the MITS newsletter, arguing that more than 90% of Microsoft Altair BASIC users had not paid Microsoft for it, and Altair's \"hobbyist market\" could discourage professional developers from creating, distributing, and maintaining high-quality software. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976 and continued to develop software in programming languages for a variety of systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979. According to Gates, he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code created by the company in its first five years of existence. As the company grew, he moved into a managerial and then supervisory role."

          "timelineText": "IBM, a leading supplier of computer hardware to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 about software for its new personal computer, the IBM PC. IBM first suggested that Microsoft write a BASIC interpreter. IBM representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), creators of the widely used CP/M operating system. However, IBM's negotiations with Digital Research were unsuccessful, and they did not reach a license agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen suggested using 86-DOS, a CP/M-like operating system that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had created for PC-like hardware. It was the prestige that Microsoft's adoption of IBM's adoption of their operating system would be the beginning of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the world's leading software company. Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright of the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer manufacturers would clone IBM's hardware. They did, making the IBM-compatible PC running DOS the de facto standard. Sales of MS-DOS (a version of DOS sold beyond IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry. Microsoft and Gates released the first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, trying to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh graphical interface, which had won over consumers with its simplicity and ease of use. In August 1986, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although both companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the collaboration broke down due to growing creative differences. The operating system evolved organically from DOS for ten years, until Windows 95 appeared, which by default hid the DOS prompt."

Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained: We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking. The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches preventing students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was \"completely improper\". In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"Thefacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, \"The Photo Address Book\", which students referred to as \"The Facebook\". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers."
